# Hey This is Ashish,
This is my part time Web Designing work which you are watching in this this project I have created a student registration form
by using HTML and CSS only.
This form contains the html extension file index.html which is basically a HTML Script and also a css extension file naming Style.css.
This form is able to contain the details the student details such as their name,contact details,parents name and their DOB.
I have created this because I have seen a lot of online form which are not much insterested so i thought to create to an attractive Registration form.
Any organisation can use it by doing just normal modification as per need.
